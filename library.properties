sentence=A lightweight Arduino library for 72x40 OLED displays with the SSD1315 and SSD1306 controller, featuring pixel, text, and bitmap drawing, multiple fonts, rotation, and brightness control.
paragraph=This library provides an efficient and easy-to-use interface for 72x40 pixel OLED displays based on the SSD1315 or SSD1306 controller. It supports drawing pixels, rectangles, bitmaps, and text with several font sizes, including a compact 5x8 font. The library offers screen rotation, adjustable brightness, and low-power sleep mode. Designed for simple integration, it works out of the box with both standard Arduino boards and ATtiny85, making it ideal for compact and low-power projects. Example sketches are included to help you get started quickly.
